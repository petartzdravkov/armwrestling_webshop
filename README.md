## Key Implementation Notes

- **Front Controller:** `public/index.php` routes requests using query parameters (e.g., `?target=product&action=index`).
- **Singleton Pattern** â€“ Used for managing a single instance of the PDO connection across the application
- **Security:** Sensitive files are stored outside `/public`. Seller-only routes are protected via session-based role checks.
- **Responsive Design:** The application uses Bootstrap 5 to support both mobile and desktop devices.
